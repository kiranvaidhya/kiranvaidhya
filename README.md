<h1 align="center">Hi there👋, I'm Kiran Vaidhya</h1>


I'm a PhD candidate at a Dutch hospital called [Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl). I work in the [Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl), and my research interests revolve around the use of deep learning algorithms for lung cancer screening. In the past, I have prototyped and built production-ready deep learning algorithms for 🤚wrist x-ray images, 🫁thorax, and abdomen CT analysis.
