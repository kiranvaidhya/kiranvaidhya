<h1 align="center">Hi there🌞I'm Kiran </h1>


🏥I'm a PhD candidate at a Dutch hospital called **[Radboudumc](https://www.radboudumc.nl)**. I work at the **[Diagnostic Image Analysis Group](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl)** (DIAG), and my research interests revolve around the use of deep learning algorithms for **medical image analysis**.

🎓I'm supervised by [**Bram van Ginneken**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bram-van-ginneken/), [**Mathias Prokop**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/), and [**Colin Jacobs**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/). My PhD thesis is on AI for lung cancer screening. Under the [**lung cancer image analysis group**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/research/lung-cancer-image-analysis/) led by Colin, we develop and validate deep learning algorithms for early detection of lung cancer from chest CT images. In my first [**publication**](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2021204433), we showed that deep learning algorithms are comparable to clinical experts at predicting lung cancer risk. This story was also covered by the **[Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/18/artificial-intelligence-just-good-picking-lung-cancer-doctors/)**. 😊 

🔮For the next couple of years, I will be exploring ways to optimize and automate lung cancer screening with deep learning algorithms. As part of my work at DIAG, I also spend 10% of my time providing support for users of **[grand-challenge.org](https://grand-challenge.org)**. 

⚙️Before starting by PhD, I worked at an early-stage startup called **[Predible](https://predible.com)** for three years, where we prototyped and built production-ready deep learning algorithms for wrist x-ray, chest CT, and abdomen CT analysis.
