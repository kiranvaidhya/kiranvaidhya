<h1 align="center">Hi there 🌞 I'm Kiran </h1>

👋 I am a co-founder and the CTO of [**Plain Medical**](https://www.plain-medical.com), a Dutch startup that develops AI solutions for radiology. We are partially supported by the Dutch government through the [**Faculty of Impact**](https://facultyofimpact.nl/) program.

🧑🏽‍🎓 I completed my PhD research under the supervision of [**Colin Jacobs**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/), [**Alessa Hering**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/alessa-hering/), [**Bram van Ginneken**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bram-van-ginneken/), and [**Mathias Prokop**](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/). I defended my PhD thesis on AI for lung cancer screening in May 2024. In my first [**publication**](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2021204433), we demonstrated that deep learning algorithms can predict lung cancer risk as effectively as clinical experts. This work was also featured by the **[Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/18/artificial-intelligence-just-good-picking-lung-cancer-doctors/)**. 😊 After my PhD, I briefly collaborated with Alessa Hering on the [**COMFORT**](https://comfort-ai.eu/) project.

During my PhD, I dedicated 10% of my time to supporting users of [**grand-challenge.org**](https://grand-challenge.org). Additionally, I volunteered as an editor for [**The Gradient**](https://www.thegradient.pub), where I managed outreach and ensured articles met publication standards.

🛠️ Before pursuing my PhD, I worked for three years at an early-stage startup called Predible (acquired by [**nference**](https://nference.com)), where we developed deep learning algorithms for analyzing wrist x-ray, chest CT, and abdomen CT images.

💙 Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, playing sports, and occasionally stargazing.
