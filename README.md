Hi! I am Kiran. I am a co-founder and the CTO of [Plain Medical](https://plain-medical.com). We develop AI solutions for radiology. We are partially supported by the Dutch government through the [Faculty of Impact](https://facultyofimpact.nl/) program.

I completed my PhD research under the supervision of [Colin Jacobs](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/colin-jacobs/), [Alessa Hering](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/alessa-hering/), [Bram van Ginneken](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/bram-van-ginneken/), and [Mathias Prokop](https://www.diagnijmegen.nl/people/mathias-prokop/). I defended my PhD thesis on AI for lung cancer screening in May 2024. In my first [publication](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2021204433), we demonstrated that deep learning algorithms can predict lung cancer risk as effectively as clinical experts. This work was also featured by the [Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2021/05/18/artificial-intelligence-just-good-picking-lung-cancer-doctors/). You can find my PhD thesis [here](https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/305547). After my PhD, I briefly collaborated with Alessa Hering on the [COMFORT](https://comfort-ai.eu/) project.

During my PhD, I dedicated 10% of my time to supporting users of [grand-challenge.org](https://grand-challenge.org). Additionally, I volunteered as an editor for [The Gradient](https://www.thegradient.pub), where I managed outreach and ensured articles met publication standards.

Before pursuing my PhD, I worked for three years at an early-stage startup called Predible (acquired by [nference](https://nference.com)), where we developed deep learning algorithms for analyzing wrist x-ray, chest CT, and abdomen CT images.

Outside of work, I enjoy cooking, playing sports, and occasionally stargazing.
